**Music Video Real-Time Lyrics Translator — A Passion Project**

TransLyric-AI is an AI-powered web app designed to translate song lyrics in real time, syncing translated subtitles with music videos. Inspired by my love for NFAK’s qawwalis, this project aims to make these beautiful songs accessible to friends and listeners worldwide by translating lyrics from their original language to English (and more), all while preserving the magic of the music.

## About This Project

This is a **passion project** I started to combine my interests in music, language, and AI. It’s designed to:

- Extract audio from YouTube music videos  
- Use advanced speech-to-text models to transcribe vocals, even in singing form  
- Translate lyrics to English and other languages with care to preserve poetic meaning  
- Display synced translated lyrics as subtitles, keeping the original music playing smoothly  

Though still a work in progress, I’m building this to share the beauty of NFAK’s qawwalis and other songs with friends who don’t speak the original language.
